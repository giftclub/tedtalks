Cameron Sinclair,My wish: A call for open-source architecture,Jul 2006,1398,I'm going to take you on a journey very quickly. To explain the wish  I'm going to have to take you somewhere where many people haven't been  and that's around the world. When I was about    years old  Kate Stohr and myself started an organization to get architects and designers involved in humanitarian work  not only about responding to natural disasters  but involved in systemic issues. We believe that where the resources and expertise are scarce  innovative  sustainable design can really make a difference in people's lives. So I started my life as an architect  or training as an architect  and I was always interested in socially responsible design  and how you can really make an impact. But when I went to architecture school  it seemed that I was a black sheep in the family. Many architects seemed to think that when you design  you design a jewel  and it's a jewel that you try and crave for  whereas I felt that when you design  you either improve or you create a detriment to the community in which you're designing. So you're not just doing a building for the residents or for the people who are going to use it  but for the community as a whole. And in       we started by responding to the issue of the housing crisis for returning refugees in Kosovo. And I didn't know what I was doing    like I said  mid   s    and I'm the Internet generation  so we started a website. We put a call out there  and to my surprise  in a couple of months  we had hundreds of entries from around the world. That led to a number of prototypes being built and really experimenting with some ideas. Two years later we started doing a project on developing mobile health clinics in sub Saharan Africa  responding to the HIV AIDS pandemic. That led to     entries from    countries. We also have designers from around the world that participate. And we had an exhibit of work that followed that.      was the tipping point for us. We started responding to natural disasters and getting involved in Iran  in Bam  also following up on our work in Africa. Working within the United States    most people look at poverty and they see the face of a foreigner. But I live in Bozeman  Montana    go up to the north plains on the reservations  or go down to Alabama or Mississippi  pre Katrina  and I could have shown you places that have far worse conditions than many developing countries that I've been to. So we got involved in and worked in inner cities and elsewhere  and also  I will go into some more projects.       Mother Nature kicked our ass. I think we can pretty much assume that      was a horrific year when it comes to natural disasters. And because of the Internet  and because of connections to blogs and so forth  within literally hours of the tsunami  we were already raising funds  getting involved  working with people on the ground. We run from a couple of laptops  and in the first couple of days  I had       emails from people needing help. So we began to get involved in projects there  and I'll talk about some others. And then of course  this year we've been responding to Katrina  as well as following up on our reconstruction work. So this is a brief overview. In       I really couldn't manage the number of people who wanted to help  or the number of requests that I was getting. It was all coming into my laptop and cell phone. So we decided to embrace an open source model of business    so that anyone  anywhere in the world  could start a local chapter  and they can get involved in local problems. Because I believe there is no such thing as Utopia. All problems are local. All solutions are local. So that means  you know  somebody who's based in Mississippi knows more about Mississippi than I do. So what happened is  we used Meetup and all these other Internet tools  and we ended up having    chapters starting up  thousands of architects in     countries. So the bullet point    sorry  I never do a suit  so I knew that I was going to take this off. OK  because I'm going to do it very quick. This isn't just about nonprofit. What it showed me is that there's a grassroots movement going on  of socially responsible designers who really believe that this world has got a lot smaller  and that we have the opportunity    not the responsibility  but the opportunity    to really get involved in making change. I'm adding that to my time. So what you don't know is  we've got these thousands of designers working around the world  connected basically by a website  and we have a staff of three. The fact that nobody told us we couldn't do it  we did it. And so there's something to be said about na vet . So seven years later  we've developed so that we've got advocacy  instigation and implementation. We advocate for good design  not only through student workshops and lectures and public forums  op eds  we have a book on humanitarian work  but also disaster mitigation and dealing with public policy. We can talk about FEMA  but that's another talk. Instigation  developing ideas with communities and NGOs  doing open source design competitions. Referring  matchmaking with communities. And then implementing    actually going out there and doing the work  because when you invent  it's never a reality until it's built. So it's really important that if we're designing and trying to create change  we build that change. So here's a select number of projects. Kosovo. This is Kosovo in '  . We did an open design competition  like I said. It led to a whole variety of ideas. And this wasn't about emergency shelter  but transitional shelter that would last five to    years  that would be placed next to the land the resident lived in  and that they would rebuild their own home. This wasn't imposing an architecture on a community  this was giving them the tools and the space to allow them to rebuild and regrow the way they want to. We had from the sublime to the ridiculous  but they worked. This is an inflatable hemp house. It was built  it works. This is a shipping container. Built and works. And a whole variety of ideas that not only dealt with architectural building  but also the issues of governance  and the idea of creating communities through complex networks. So we've engaged not just designers  but also a whole variety of technology based professionals. Using rubble from destroyed homes to create new homes. Using straw bale construction  creating heat walls. And then something remarkable happened in '  . We went to Africa originally to look at the housing issue. Within three days  we realized the problem was not housing  it was the growing pandemic of HIV AIDS. And it wasn't doctors telling us this  it was actual villagers that we were staying with. And so we came up with the bright idea that instead of getting people to walk        kilometers to see doctors  you get the doctors to the people. And we started engaging the medical community  and you know  we thought we were real bright sparks     We've come up with this great idea  mobile health clinics  widely distributed throughout sub Saharan Africa.  And the medical community there said   We've said this for the last decade. We know this. We just don't know how to show this.  So in a way  we had taken pre existing needs and shown solutions. And so again  we had a whole variety of ideas that came in. This one I personally love  because the idea is that architecture is not just about solutions  but about raising awareness. This is a kenaf clinic. You get seed and you grow it in a plot of land  and it grows    feet in a month. And on the fourth week  the doctors come and they mow out an area  put a tensile structure on the top  and when the doctors have finished treating and seeing patients and villagers  you cut down the clinic and you eat it. It's an eat your own clinic. So it's dealing with the fact that if you have AIDS  you also need to have nutrition rates  and the idea of nutrition is as important as getting antiretrovirals out there. So you know  this is a serious solution. This one I love. The idea is it's not just a clinic  it's a community center. This looked at setting up trade routes and economic engines within the community  so it can be a self sustaining project. Every one of these projects is sustainable. That's not because I'm a tree hugging green person. It's because when you live on four dollars a day  you're living on survival and you have to be sustainable. You have to know where your energy is coming from  you have to know where your resource is coming from  and you have to keep the maintenance down. So this is about getting an economic engine  and then at night  it turns into a movie theater. So it's not an AIDS clinic. It's a community center. So you can see ideas. And these ideas developed into prototypes  and they were eventually built. And currently  as of this year  there are clinics rolling out in Nigeria and Kenya. From that  we also developed Siyathemba. The community came to us and said   The problem is that the girls don't have education.  And we're working in an area where young women between the ages of    and    have a    percent HIV AIDS rate. And that's not because they're promiscuous  it's because there's no knowledge. And so we decided to look at the idea of sports  and create a youth sports center that doubled as an HIV AIDS outreach center  and the coaches of the girls' team were also trained doctors. So that there would be a very slow way of developing confidence in health care. And we picked nine finalists  and then those nine finalists were distributed throughout the entire region  and then the community picked their design. They said  this is our design  because it's not only about engaging a community  it's about empowering a community  and about getting them to be a part of the rebuilding process. So  the winning design is here. And then  of course  we actually go and work with the community and the clients. So this is the designer. He's out there working with the first ever women's soccer team in KwaZulu Natal  Siyathemba. And they can tell it better. Video  Well  my name is Cee Cee Mkhonza. I work at the Africa Centre  I'm an IT user consultant. I'm also the national football player for South Africa  Banyana Banyana. And I also play in the Vodacom League  for the team called Tembisa  which has now changed to Siyathemba. This is our home ground. Cameron Sinclair  I'm going to show that later because I'm running out of time. I can see Chris looking at me slyly. This was a connection  just a meeting with somebody who wanted to develop Africa's first telemedicine center  in Tanzania. And we met  literally  a couple of months ago. We've already developed a design. The team is over there  working in partnership. This was a matchmaking  thanks to a couple of TEDsters    Sun  Microsystems   Cheryl Heller and Andrew Zolli  who connected me with this amazing African woman. And we start construction in June  and it will be opened by TEDGlobal. So when you come to TEDGlobal  you can check it out. But what we're known probably most for is dealing with disasters and development  and we've been involved in a lot of issues  such as the tsunami and also things like Hurricane Katrina. This is a     dollar shelter that can be easily assembled. This is a community designed community center. And what that means is we actually live and work with the community  and they're part of the design process. The kids actually get involved in mapping out where the community center should be. And then eventually  the community  through skills training  end up building the building with us. Here is another school. This is what the UN gave these guys for six months       plastic tarps. This was in August. This was the replacement  that's supposed to last for two years. When the rain comes down  you can't hear a thing  and in the summer  it's about     degrees inside. So we said  if the rain's coming down  let's get fresh water. So every one of our schools has a rainwater collection system. Very low cost  three classrooms and rainwater collection is       dollars. This was raised by hot chocolate sales in Atlanta. It's built by the parents of the kids. The kids are out there on site  building the buildings. And it opened a couple of weeks ago  and there's     kids that are now using the schools. So  disaster hits home. We see the bad stories on CNN and Fox and all that  but we don't see the good stories. Here is a community that got together  and they said  no  to waiting. They formed a partnership  a diverse partnership of players  to actually map out East Biloxi  to figure out who's getting involved. We've had over       volunteers rebuilding  rehabbing homes. Figuring out what FEMA regulations are  not waiting for them to dictate to us how you should rebuild. Working with residents  getting them out of their homes  so they don't get ill. This is what they're cleaning up on their own. Designing housing. This house is going in in a couple of weeks. This is a rehabbed home  done in four days. This is a utility room for a woman who is on a walker. She's    years old. This is what FEMA gave her.     bucks  happened two days ago. We put together  very quickly  a washroom. It's built  it's running and she just started a business today  where she's washing other people's clothes. These are the Calhouns. They're photographers who had documented the Lower Ninth for the last    years. That was their home  and these are the photographs they took. And we're helping  working with them to create a new building. Projects we've done. Projects we've been a part of  support. Why don't aid agencies do this  This is the UN tent. This is the new UN tent  just introduced this year. Quick to assemble. It's got a flap    that's the invention. It took    years to design this and get it implemented in the field. I was    years old. There's a problem here. Luckily  we're not alone. There are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of architects and designers and inventors around the world that are getting involved in humanitarian work. More hemp houses    it's a theme in Japan  apparently. I'm not sure what they're smoking. This is a Grip Clip  designed by somebody who said   All you need is some way to attach membrane structures to physical support beams.  This guy designed for NASA  is now doing housing. I'm going to whip through this quickly  because I know I've got only a couple of minutes. So this is all done in the last two years. I showed you something that took    years to do. And this is just a selection of things that were built in the last couple of years. From Brazil to India  Mexico  Alabama  China  Israel  Palestine  Vietnam. The average age of a designer who gets involved in this project is       that's how old I am. So it's a young    I just have to stop here  because Arup is in the room  and this is the best designed toilet in the world. If you're ever  ever in India  go use this toilet. Chris Luebkeman will tell you why. I'm sure that's how he wanted to spend the party. But the future is not going to be the sky scraping cities of New York  but this. And when you look at this  you see crisis. What I see is many  many inventors. One billion people live in abject poverty. We hear about them all the time. Four billion live in growing but fragile economies. One in seven live in unplanned settlements. If we do nothing about the housing crisis that's about to happen  in    years  one in three people will live in an unplanned settlement or a refugee camp. Look left  look right  one of you will be there. How do we improve the living standards of five billion people  With    million solutions. So I wish to develop a community that actively embraces innovative and sustainable design to improve the living conditions for everyone. Chris Anderson  Wait a sec    that's your wish  CS  That's my wish. CA  That's his wish  CS  We started Architecture for Humanity with     dollars and a website. So Chris somehow decided to give me        . So why not this many people  Open source architecture is the way to go. You have a diverse community of participants    and we're not just talking about inventors and designers  but we're talking about the funding model. My role is not as a designer  it's as a conduit between the design world and the humanitarian world. And what we need is something that replicates me globally  because I haven't slept in seven years. Secondly  what will this thing be  Designers want to respond to issues of humanitarian crisis  but they don't want some company in the West taking their idea and basically profiting from it. So Creative Commons has developed the Developing Nations license. And what that means is that a designer can    The Siyathemba project I showed was the first ever building to have a Creative Commons license on it. As soon as that is built  anyone in Africa or any developing nation can take the construction documents and replicate it for free. So why not allow designers the opportunity to do this  but still protect their rights here  We want to have a community where you can upload ideas  and those ideas can be tested in an earthquake  in flood  in all sorts of austere environments. The reason that's important is I don't want to wait for the next Katrina to find out if my house works. That's too late  we need to do it now. So doing that globally    and I want this whole thing to work multi lingually. When you look at the face of an architect  most people think a gray haired white guy. I don't see that  I see the face of the world. So I want everyone from all over the planet to be able to be a part of this design and development. The idea of needs based competitions    XPRIZE for the other    percent  if you want to call it that. We also want to look at ways of matchmaking and putting funding partners together  and the idea of integrating manufacturers    fab labs in every country. When I hear about the      laptop and it's going to educate every child    educate every designer in the world. Put one in every favela  every slum settlement. Because you know what  Innovation will happen. And I need to know that. It's called the leap back. We talk about leapfrog technologies. I write with Worldchanging  and the one thing we've been talking about is  I learn more on the ground than I've ever learned here. So let's take those ideas  adapt them  and we can use them. These ideas are supposed to be adaptable  they should have the potential for evolution  they should be developed by every nation in the world and useful for every nation in the world. What will it take  There should be a sheet. I don't have time to read this  because I'm going to be yanked off. CA  Let's just leave it up for a sec. CS  Well  what will it take  You guys are smart. So it's going to take a lot of computing power  because I want the idea that any laptop anywhere in the world can plug into the system and be able to not only participate in developing these designs  but utilize the designs. Also  a process of reviewing the designs. I want every Arup engineer in the world to check and make sure that we're doing stuff that's standing  because those guys are the best in the world. Plug. And so  you know  I want these    I just should note  I have two laptops and one of them is there  and that has      designs on it. If I drop that laptop ... What happens  So it's important to have these proven ideas put up there  easy to use  easy to get ahold of. My mom once said   There's nothing worse than being all mouth and no trousers.  I'm fed up of talking about making change. You only make it by doing it. We've changed FEMA guidelines  we've changed public policy  we've changed international response    based on building things. So for me  it's important that we create a real conduit for innovation  and that it's free innovation. Think of free culture    this is free innovation. Somebody said this a couple of years back. I will give points for those who know it. But I think the man was maybe    years too early. So let's do it. Thank you.
Hans Rosling,The best stats you've ever seen,Jun 2006,1179,About    years ago  I took on the task to teach global development to Swedish undergraduate students. That was after having spent about    years together with African institutions studying hunger in Africa  so I was sort of expected to know a little about the world. And I started in our medical university  Karolinska Institute  an undergraduate course called Global Health. But when you get that opportunity  you get a little nervous. I thought  these students coming to us actually have the highest grade you can get in Swedish college systems    so I thought  maybe they know everything I'm going to teach them about. So I did a pre test when they came. And one of the questions from which I learned a lot was this one   Which country has the highest child mortality of these five pairs   I put them together  so that in each pair of country  one has twice the child mortality of the other. And this means that it's much bigger a difference than the uncertainty of the data. I won't put you at a test here  but it's Turkey  which is highest there  Poland  Russia  Pakistan and South Africa. And these were the results of the Swedish students. I did it so I got the confidence interval  which is pretty narrow  and I got happy  of course  a  .  right answer out of five possible. That means that there was a place for a professor of international health and for my course. But one late night  when I was compiling the report  I really realized my discovery. I have shown that Swedish top students know statistically significantly less about the world than the chimpanzees. Because the chimpanzee would score half right if I gave them two bananas with Sri Lanka and Turkey. They would be right half of the cases. But the students are not there. The problem for me was not ignorance  it was preconceived ideas. I did also an unethical study of the professors of the Karolinska Institute  that hands out the Nobel Prize in Medicine  and they are on par with the chimpanzee there. This is where I realized that there was really a need to communicate  because the data of what's happening in the world and the child health of every country is very well aware. We did this software which displays it like this  every bubble here is a country. This country over here is China. This is India. The size of the bubble is the population  and on this axis here  I put fertility rate. Because my students  what they said when they looked upon the world  and I asked them   What do you really think about the world   Well  I first discovered that the textbook was Tintin  mainly. And they said   The world is still 'we' and 'them.' And 'we' is Western world and 'them' is Third World.   And what do you mean with Western world   I said.  Well  that's long life and small family  and Third World is short life and large family.  So this is what I could display here. I put fertility rate here  number of children per woman  one  two  three  four  up to about eight children per woman. We have very good data since              about    on the size of families in all countries. The error margin is narrow. Here  I put life expectancy at birth  from    years in some countries up to about    years. And       there was really a group of countries here that was industrialized countries  and they had small families and long lives. And these were the developing countries  they had large families and they had relatively short lives. Now  what has happened since       We want to see the change. Are the students right  Is it still two types of countries  Or have these developing countries got smaller families and they live here  Or have they got longer lives and live up there  Let's see. We stopped the world then. This is all U.N. statistics that have been available. Here we go. Can you see there  It's China there  moving against better health there  improving there. All the green Latin American countries are moving towards smaller families. Your yellow ones here are the Arabic countries  and they get longer life  but not larger families. The Africans are the green here. They still remain here. This is India  Indonesia is moving on pretty fast. In the '  s here  you have Bangladesh still among the African countries. But now  Bangladesh    it's a miracle that happens in the '  s  the imams start to promote family planning. They move up into that corner. And in the '  s  we have the terrible HIV epidemic that takes down the life expectancy of the African countries and all the rest of them move up into the corner  where we have long lives and small family  and we have a completely new world. Let me make a comparison directly between the United States of America and Vietnam.     . America had small families and long life  Vietnam had large families and short lives. And this is what happens  the data during the war indicate that even with all the death  there was an improvement of life expectancy. By the end of the year  the family planning started in Vietnam  they went for smaller families. And the United States up there is getting for longer life  keeping family size. And in the '  s now  they give up Communist planning and they go for market economy  and it moves faster even than social life. And today  we have in Vietnam the same life expectancy and the same family size here in Vietnam        as in United States        by the end of the war. If we don't look in the data  I think we all underestimate the tremendous change in Asia  which was in social change before we saw the economical change. Let's move over to another way here in which we could display the distribution in the world of the income. This is the world distribution of income of people. One dollar     dollars or     dollars per day. There's no gap between rich and poor any longer. This is a myth. There's a little hump here. But there are people all the way. And if we look where the income ends up  this is     percent the world's annual income. And the richest    percent  they take out of that about    percent. And the poorest    percent  they take about two percent. And this shows that the concept of developing countries is extremely doubtful. We think about aid  like these people here giving aid to these people here. But in the middle  we have most of the world population  and they have now    percent of the income. We heard it in other forms. And who are these  Where are the different countries  I can show you Africa. This is Africa.     the world population  most in poverty. This is OECD. The rich country. The country club of the U.N. And they are over here on this side. Quite an overlap between Africa and OECD. And this is Latin America. It has everything on this Earth  from the poorest to the richest in Latin America. And on top of that  we can put East Europe  we can put East Asia  and we put South Asia. And how did it look like if we go back in time  to about       Then there was more of a hump. And we have most who lived in absolute poverty were Asians. The problem in the world was the poverty in Asia. And if I now let the world move forward  you will see that while population increases  there are hundreds of millions in Asia getting out of poverty and some others getting into poverty  and this is the pattern we have today. And the best projection from the World Bank is that this will happen  and we will not have a divided world. We'll have most people in the middle. Of course it's a logarithmic scale here  but our concept of economy is growth with percent. We look upon it as a possibility of percentile increase. If I change this  and take GDP per capita instead of family income  and I turn these individual data into regional data of gross domestic product  and I take the regions down here  the size of the bubble is still the population. And you have the OECD there  and you have sub Saharan Africa there  and we take off the Arab states there  coming both from Africa and from Asia  and we put them separately  and we can expand this axis  and I can give it a new dimension here  by adding the social values there  child survival. Now I have money on that axis  and I have the possibility of children to survive there. In some countries    .   of children survive to five years of age  others  only   . And here  it seems  there is a gap between OECD  Latin America  East Europe  East Asia  Arab states  South Asia and sub Saharan Africa. The linearity is very strong between child survival and money. But let me split sub Saharan Africa. Health is there and better health is up there. I can go here and I can split sub Saharan Africa into its countries. And when it burst  the size of its country bubble is the size of the population. Sierra Leone down there. Mauritius is up there. Mauritius was the first country to get away with trade barriers  and they could sell their sugar    they could sell their textiles    on equal terms as the people in Europe and North America. There's a huge difference between Africa. And Ghana is here in the middle. In Sierra Leone  humanitarian aid. Here in Uganda  development aid. Here  time to invest  there  you can go for a holiday. It's a tremendous variation within Africa which we rarely often make    that it's equal everything. I can split South Asia here. India's the big bubble in the middle. But a huge difference between Afghanistan and Sri Lanka. I can split Arab states. How are they  Same climate  same culture  same religion    huge difference. Even between neighbors. Yemen  civil war. United Arab Emirates  money  which was quite equally and well used. Not as the myth is. And that includes all the children of the foreign workers who are in the country. Data is often better than you think. Many people say data is bad. There is an uncertainty margin  but we can see the difference here  Cambodia  Singapore. The differences are much bigger than the weakness of the data. East Europe  Soviet economy for a long time  but they come out after    years very  very differently. And there is Latin America. Today  we don't have to go to Cuba to find a healthy country in Latin America. Chile will have a lower child mortality than Cuba within some few years from now. Here  we have high income countries in the OECD. And we get the whole pattern here of the world  which is more or less like this. And if we look at it  how the world looks  in       it starts to move. This is Mao Tse tung. He brought health to China. And then he died. And then Deng Xiaoping came and brought money to China  and brought them into the mainstream again. And we have seen how countries move in different directions like this  so it's sort of difficult to get an example country which shows the pattern of the world. But I would like to bring you back to about here  at     . I would like to compare South Korea  which is this one  with Brazil  which is this one. The label went away for me here. And I would like to compare Uganda  which is there. And I can run it forward  like this. And you can see how South Korea is making a very  very fast advancement  whereas Brazil is much slower. And if we move back again  here  and we put on trails on them  like this  you can see again that the speed of development is very  very different  and the countries are moving more or less in the same rate as money and health  but it seems you can move much faster if you are healthy first than if you are wealthy first. And to show that  you can put on the way of United Arab Emirates. They came from here  a mineral country. They cached all the oil  they got all the money  but health cannot be bought at the supermarket. You have to invest in health. You have to get kids into schooling. You have to train health staff. You have to educate the population. And Sheikh Zayed did that in a fairly good way. In spite of falling oil prices  he brought this country up here. So we've got a much more mainstream appearance of the world  where all countries tend to use their money better than they used in the past. Now  this is  more or less  if you look at the average data of the countries    they are like this. Now that's dangerous  to use average data  because there is such a lot of difference within countries. So if I go and look here  we can see that Uganda today is where South Korea was in     . If I split Uganda  there's quite a difference within Uganda. These are the quintiles of Uganda. The richest    percent of Ugandans are there. The poorest are down there. If I split South Africa  it's like this. And if I go down and look at Niger  where there was such a terrible famine  lastly  it's like this. The    percent poorest of Niger is out here  and the    percent richest of South Africa is there  and yet we tend to discuss on what solutions there should be in Africa. Everything in this world exists in Africa. And you can't discuss universal access to HIV  medicine  for that quintile up here with the same strategy as down here. The improvement of the world must be highly contextualized  and it's not relevant to have it on regional level. We must be much more detailed. We find that students get very excited when they can use this. And even more  policy makers and the corporate sectors would like to see how the world is changing. Now  why doesn't this take place  Why are we not using the data we have  We have data in the United Nations  in the national statistical agencies and in universities and other non governmental organizations. Because the data is hidden down in the databases. And the public is there  and the Internet is there  but we have still not used it effectively. All that information we saw changing in the world does not include publicly funded statistics. There are some web pages like this  you know  but they take some nourishment down from the databases  but people put prices on them  stupid passwords and boring statistics. And this won't work. So what is needed  We have the databases. It's not the new database you need. We have wonderful design tools  and more and more are added up here. So we started a nonprofit venture which  linking data to design  we called Gapminder  from the London Underground  where they warn you   mind the gap.  So we thought Gapminder was appropriate. And we started to write software which could link the data like this. And it wasn't that difficult. It took some person years  and we have produced animations. You can take a data set and put it there. We are liberating U.N. data  some few U.N. organization. Some countries accept that their databases can go out on the world  but what we really need is  of course  a search function. A search function where we can copy the data up to a searchable format and get it out in the world. And what do we hear when we go around  I've done anthropology on the main statistical units. Everyone says   It's impossible. This can't be done. Our information is so peculiar in detail  so that cannot be searched as others can be searched. We cannot give the data free to the students  free to the entrepreneurs of the world.  But this is what we would like to see  isn't it  The publicly funded data is down here. And we would like flowers to grow out on the Net. And one of the crucial points is to make them searchable  and then people can use the different design tool to animate it there. And I have pretty good news for you. I have good news that the present  new Head of U.N. Statistics  he doesn't say it's impossible. He only says   We can't do it.  And that's a quite clever guy  huh  So we can see a lot happening in data in the coming years. We will be able to look at income distributions in completely new ways. This is the income distribution of China      . This is the income distribution of the United States      . Almost no overlap. And what has happened  What has happened is this  that China is growing  it's not so equal any longer  and it's appearing here  overlooking the United States. Almost like a ghost  isn't it  It's pretty scary. But I think it's very important to have all this information. We need really to see it. And instead of looking at this  I would like to end up by showing the Internet users per      . In this software  we access about     variables from all the countries quite easily. It takes some time to change for this  but on the axises  you can quite easily get any variable you would like to have. And the thing would be to get up the databases free  to get them searchable  and with a second click  to get them into the graphic formats  where you can instantly understand them. Now  statisticians don't like it  because they say that this will not show the reality  we have to have statistical  analytical methods. But this is hypothesis generating. I end now with the world. There  the Internet is coming. The number of Internet users are going up like this. This is the GDP per capita. And it's a new technology coming in  but then amazingly  how well it fits to the economy of the countries. That's why the      computer will be so important. But it's a nice tendency. It's as if the world is flattening off  isn't it  These countries are lifting more than the economy and will be very interesting to follow this over the year  as I would like you to be able to do with all the publicly funded data. Thank you very much.
Tony Robbins,Why we do what we do,Jun 2006,1289,Thank you. I have to tell you I'm both challenged and excited. My excitement is  I get a chance to give something back. My challenge is  the shortest seminar I usually do is    hours. I'm not exaggerating. I do weekends    I do more  obviously  I also coach people    but I'm into immersion  because how did you learn language  Not just by learning principles  you got in it and you did it so often that it became real. The bottom line of why I'm here  besides being a crazy mofo  is that    I'm not here to motivate you  you don't need that  obviously. Often that's what people think I do  and it's the furthest thing from it. What happens  though  is people say to me   I don't need any motivation.  But that's not what I do. I'm the  why  guy. I want to know why you do what you do. What is your motive for action  What is it that drives you in your life today  Not    years ago. Are you running the same pattern  Because I believe that the invisible force of internal drive  activated  is the most important thing. I'm here because I believe emotion is the force of life. All of us here have great minds. Most of us here have great minds  right  We all know how to think. With our minds we can rationalize anything. We can make anything happen. I agree with what was described a few days ago  that people work in their self interest. But we know that that's bullshit at times. You don't work in your self interest all the time  because when emotion comes into it  the wiring changes in the way it functions. So it's wonderful to think intellectually about how the life of the world is  especially those who are very smart can play this game in our head. But I really want to know what's driving you. What I would like to invite you to do by the end of this talk is explore where you are today  for two reasons. One  so that you can contribute more. And two  that hopefully we can not just understand other people more  but appreciate them more  and create the kinds of connections that can stop some of the challenges that we face today. They're only going to get magnified by the very technology that connects us  because it's making us intersect. That intersection doesn't always create a view of  everybody now understands everybody  and everybody appreciates everybody.  I've had an obsession basically for    years   What makes the difference in the quality of people's lives  What in their performance   I got hired to produce the result now. I've done it for    years. I get the phone call when the athlete is burning down on national television  and they were ahead by five strokes and now they can't get back on the course. I've got to do something right now or nothing matters. I get the phone call when the child is going to commit suicide  I've got to do something. In    years  I'm very grateful to tell you I've never lost one. It doesn't mean I won't some day  but I haven't yet. The reason is an understanding of these human needs. When I get those calls about performance  that's one thing. How do you make a change  I'm also looking to see what is shaping the person's ability to contribute  to do something beyond themselves. Maybe the real question is  I look at life and say there's two master lessons. One is  there's the science of achievement  which almost everyone here has mastered amazingly.  How do you take the invisible and make it visible   How do you make your dreams happen  Your business  your contribution to society  money    whatever  your body  your family. The other lesson that is rarely mastered is the art of fulfillment. Because science is easy  right  We know the rules  you write the code and you get the results. Once you know the game  you just up the ante  don't you  But when it comes to fulfillment    that's an art. The reason is  it's about appreciation and contribution. You can only feel so much by yourself. I've had an interesting laboratory to try to answer the real question how somebody's life changes if you look at them like those people that you've given everything to  Like all the resources they say they need. You gave not a     dollar computer  but the best computer. You gave them love  joy  were there to comfort them. Those people very often    you know some of them    end up the rest of their life with all this love  education  money and background going in and out of rehab. Some people have been through ultimate pain  psychologically  sexually  spiritually  emotionally abused    and not always  but often  they become some of the people that contribute the most to society. The question we've got to ask ourselves really is  what is it  What is it that shapes us  We live in a therapy culture. Most of us don't do that  but the culture's a therapy culture  the mindset that we are our past. And you wouldn't be in this room if you bought that  but most of society thinks biography is destiny. The past equals the future. Of course it does if you live there. But what we know and what we have to remind ourselves    because you can know something intellectually and then not use it  not apply it. We've got to remind ourselves that decision is the ultimate power. When you ask people  have you failed to achieve something significant in your life  Say   Aye.  Audience  Aye. TR  Thanks for the interaction on a high level there. But if you ask people  why didn't you achieve something  Somebody who's working for you  or a partner  or even yourself. When you fail to achieve  what's the reason people say  What do they tell you  Didn't have the knowledge  didn't have the money  didn't have the time  didn't have the technology. I didn't have the right manager. Al Gore  Supreme Court. TR  The Supreme Court. TR  And    What do all those  including the Supreme Court  have in common  They are a claim to you missing resources  and they may be accurate. You may not have the money  or the Supreme Court  but that is not the defining factor. And you correct me if I'm wrong. The defining factor is never resources  it's resourcefulness. And what I mean specifically  rather than just some phrase  is if you have emotion  human emotion  something that I experienced from you the day before yesterday at a level that is as profound as I've ever experienced and I believe with that emotion you would have beat his ass and won. Audience  Yeah  How easy for me to tell him what he should do. Idiot  Robbins. But I know when we watched the debate at that time  there were emotions that blocked people's ability to get this man's intellect and capacity. And the way that it came across to some people on that day    because I know people that wanted to vote in your direction and didn't  and I was upset. But there was emotion there. Do you know what I'm talking about  Say   Aye.  Audience  Aye. TR  So  emotion is it. And if we get the right emotion  we can get ourselves to do anything. If you're creative  playful  fun enough  can you get through to anybody  yes or no  If you don't have the money  but you're creative and determined  you find the way. This is the ultimate resource. But this is not the story that people tell us. They tell us a bunch of different stories. They tell us we don't have the resources  but ultimately  if you take a look here  they say  what are all the reasons they haven't accomplished that  He's broken my pattern  that son of a bitch. But I appreciated the energy  I'll tell you that. What determines your resources  We've said decisions shape destiny  which is my focus here. If decisions shape destiny  what determines it is three decisions. What will you focus on  You have to decide what you're going to focus on. Consciously or unconsciously. the minute you decide to focus  you must give it a meaning  and that meaning produces emotion. Is this the end or the beginning  Is God punishing me or rewarding me  or is this the roll of the dice  An emotion creates what we're going to do  or the action. So  think about your own life  the decisions that have shaped your destiny. And that sounds really heavy  but in the last five or    years  have there been some decisions that if you'd made a different decision  your life would be completely different  How many can think about it  Better or worse. Say   Aye.  Audience  Aye. So the bottom line is  maybe it was where to go to work  and you met the love of your life there  a career decision. I know the Google geniuses I saw here    I mean  I understand that their decision was to sell their technology. What if they made that decision versus to build their own culture  How would the world or their lives be different  their impact  The history of our world is these decisions. When a woman stands up and says   No  I won't go to the back of the bus.  She didn't just affect her life. That decision shaped our culture. Or someone standing in front of a tank. Or being in a position like Lance Armstrong   You've got testicular cancer.  That's pretty tough for any male  especially if you ride a bike. You've got it in your brain  you've got it in your lungs. But what was his decision of what to focus on  Different than most people. What did it mean  It wasn't the end  it was the beginning. He goes off and wins seven championships he never once won before the cancer  because he got emotional fitness  psychological strength. That's the difference in human beings that I've seen of the three million I've been around. In my lab  I've had three million people from    countries over the last    years. And after a while  patterns become obvious. You see that South America and Africa may be connected in a certain way  right  Others say   Oh  that sounds ridiculous.  It's simple. So  what shaped Lance  What shapes you  Two invisible forces. Very quickly. One  state. We all have had times  you did something  and after  you thought to yourself   I can't believe I said or did that  that was so stupid.  Who's been there  Say   Aye.  Audience  Aye. Or after you did something  you go   That was me   It wasn't your ability  it was your state. Your model of the world is what shapes you long term. Your model of the world is the filter. That's what's shaping us. It makes people make decisions. To influence somebody  we need to know what already influences them. It's made up of three parts. First  what's your target  What are you after  It's not your desires. You can get your desires or goals. Who has ever got a goal or desire and thought  is this all there is  Say   Aye.  Audience  Aye. It's needs we have. I believe there are six human needs. Second  once you know what the target that's driving you is and you uncover it for the truth    you don't form it    then you find out what's your map  what's the belief systems that tell you how to get those needs. Some people think the way to get them is to destroy the world  some people  to build  create something  love someone. There's the fuel you pick. So very quickly  six needs. Let me tell you what they are. First one  certainty. These are not goals or desires  these are universal. Everyone needs certainty they can avoid pain and at least be comfortable. Now  how do you get it  Control everybody  Develop a skill  Give up  Smoke a cigarette  And if you got totally certain  ironically  even though we need that    you're not certain about your health  or your children  or money. If you're not sure the ceiling will hold up  you won't listen to any speaker. While we go for certainty differently  if we get total certainty  we get what  What do you feel if you're certain  You know what will happen  when and how it will happen  what would you feel  Bored out of your minds. So  God  in Her infinite wisdom  gave us a second human need  which is uncertainty. We need variety. We need surprise. How many of you here love surprises  Say   Aye.  Audience  Aye. TR  Bullshit. You like the surprises you want. The ones you don't want  you call problems  but you need them. So  variety is important. Have you ever rented a video or a film that you've already seen  Who's done this  Get a fucking life. Why are you doing it  You're certain it's good because you read or saw it before  but you're hoping it's been long enough you've forgotten  and there's variety. Third human need  critical  significance. We all need to feel important  special  unique. You can get it by making more money or being more spiritual. You can do it by getting yourself in a situation where you put more tattoos and earrings in places humans don't want to know. Whatever it takes. The fastest way to do this  if you have no background  no culture  no belief and resources or resourcefulness  is violence. If I put a gun to your head and I live in the 'hood  instantly I'm significant. Zero to   . How high    . How certain am I that you're going to respond to me    . How much uncertainty  Who knows what's going to happen next  Kind of exciting. Like climbing up into a cave and doing that stuff all the way down there. Total variety and uncertainty. And it's significant  isn't it  So you want to risk your life for it. So that's why violence has always been around and will be around unless we have a consciousness change as a species. You can get significance a million ways  but to be significant  you've got to be unique and different. Here's what we really need  connection and love  fourth need. We all want it  most settle for connection  love's too scary. Who here has been hurt in an intimate relationship  If you don't raise your hand  you've had other shit  too. And you're going to get hurt again. Aren't you glad you came to this positive visit  Here's what's true  we need it. We can do it through intimacy  friendship  prayer  through walking in nature. If nothing else works for you  don't get a cat  get a dog  because if you leave for two minutes  it's like you've been gone six months  when you come back   minutes later. These first four needs  every human finds a way to meet. Even if you lie to yourself  you need to have split personalities. I call the first four needs the needs of the personality. The last two are the needs of the spirit. And this is where fulfillment comes. You won't get it from the first four. You'll figure a way  smoke  drink  do whatever  meet the first four. But number five  you must grow. We all know the answer. If you don't grow  you're what  If a relationship or business is not growing  if you're not growing  doesn't matter how much money or friends you have  how many love you  you feel like hell. And I believe the reason we grow is so we have something to give of value. Because the sixth need is to contribute beyond ourselves. Because we all know  corny as that sounds  the secret to living is giving. We all know life is not about me  it's about we. This culture knows that  this room knows that. It's exciting. When you see Nicholas talking about his      computer  the most exciting thing is  here's a genius  but he's got a calling now. You can feel the difference in him  and it's beautiful. And that calling can touch other people. My life was touched because when I was    years old  Thanksgiving  no money  no food  we were not going to starve  but my father was totally messed up  my mom was letting him know how bad he messed up  and somebody came to the door and delivered food. My father made three decisions  I know what they were  briefly. His focus was  This is charity. What does it mean  I'm worthless. What do I have to do  Leave my family   which he did. It was one of the most painful experiences of life. My three decisions gave me a different path. I set focus on  There's food.  What a concept  But this is what changed my life  shaped me as a human being. Somebody's gift  I don't even know who it is. My father always said   No one gives a shit.  And now somebody I don't know  they're not asking for anything  just giving us food  looking out for us. It made me believe this  that strangers care. And that made me decide  if strangers care about me and my family  I care about them. I'm going to do something to make a difference. So when I was     I went out on Thanksgiving  it was my target for years to have enough money to feed two families. The most fun and moving thing I ever did in my life. Next year  I did four  then eight. I didn't tell anybody what I was doing  I wasn't doing it for brownie points. But after eight  I thought I could use some help. So I went out  got my friends involved  then I grew companies  got     and I built the foundation.    years later  I'm proud to tell you last year we fed   million people in    countries through our foundation. All during the holidays  Thanksgiving  Christmas  in different countries around the world. Thank you. I don't tell you that to brag  but because I'm proud of human beings because they get excited to contribute once they've had the chance to experience it  not talk about it. So  finally    I'm about out of time. The target that shapes you    Here's what's different about people. We have the same needs. But are you a certainty freak  is that what you value most  or uncertainty  This man couldn't be a certainty freak if he climbed through those caves. Are you driven by significance or love  We all need all six  but what your lead system is tilts you in a different direction. And as you move in a direction  you have a destination or destiny. The second piece is the map. The operating system tells you how to get there  and some people's map is   I'm going to save lives even if I die for other people   and they're a fireman  and somebody else says   I'm going to kill people to do it.  They're trying to meet the same needs of significance. They want to honor God or honor their family. But they have a different map. And there are seven different beliefs  I can't go through them  because I'm done. The last piece is emotion. One of the parts of the map is like time. Some people's idea of a long time is     years. Somebody else's is three seconds  which is what I have. And the last one I've already mentioned that fell to you. If you've got a target and a map    I can't use Google because I love Macs  and they haven't made it good for Macs yet. So if you use MapQuest    how many have made this fatal mistake of using it  You use this thing and you don't get there. Imagine if your beliefs guarantee you can never get to where you want to go. The last thing is emotion. Here's what I'll tell you about emotion. There are       emotions that we have words for in the English language  which is just a linguistic representation that changes by language. But if your dominant emotions    If I have        people or       and I have them write down all the emotions that they experience in an average week  and I give them as long as they need  and on one side they write empowering emotions  the other's disempowering  guess how many emotions they experience  Less than   . And half of those make them feel like shit. They have six good feelings. Happy  happy  excited  oh shit  frustrated  frustrated  overwhelmed  depressed. How many of you know somebody who  no matter what happens  finds a way to get pissed off  Or no matter what happens  they find a way to be happy or excited. How many of you know somebody like this  When      happened  I'll finish with this  I was in Hawaii. I was with       people from    countries  we were translating four languages simultaneously for a program I was conducting  for a week. The night before was called Emotional Mastery. I got up  had no plan for this  and I said    we had fireworks  I do crazy shit  fun stuff  and at the end  I stopped. I had this plan  but I never know what I'm going to say. And all of a sudden  I said   When do people really start to live  When they face death.  And I went through this whole thing about  if you weren't going to get off this island  if nine days from now  you were going to die  who would you call  what would you say  what would you do  That night is when      happened. One woman had come to the seminar  and when she came there  her previous boyfriend had been kidnapped and murdered. Her new boyfriend wanted to marry her  and she said no. He said   If you go to that Hawaii thing  it's over with us.  She said   It's over.  When I finished that night  she called him and left a message at the top of the World Trade Center where he worked  saying   I love you  I want you to know I want to marry you. It was stupid of me.  She was asleep  because it was   a.m. for us  when he called her back  and said   Honey  I can't tell you what this means. I don't know how to tell you this  but you gave me the greatest gift  because I'm going to die.  And she played the recording for us in the room. She was on Larry King later. And he said   You're probably wondering how on Earth this could happen to you twice. All I can say is this must be God's message to you. From now on  every day  give your all  love your all. Don't let anything ever stop you.  She finishes  and a man stands up  and he says   I'm from Pakistan  I'm a Muslim. I'd love to hold your hand and say I'm sorry  but frankly  this is retribution.  I can't tell you the rest  because I'm out of time. Are you sure     seconds     seconds  I want to be respectful. All I can tell you is  I brought this man on stage with a man from New York who worked in the World Trade Center  because I had about     New Yorkers there. More than    lost their entire companies  friends  marking off their Palm Pilots. One financial trader  woman made of steel  bawling       friends crossing off that all died. And I said   What are we going to focus on  What does this mean and what are we going to do   And I got the group to focus on  if you didn't lose somebody today  your focus is going to be how to serve somebody else. Then one woman stood up and was so angry  screaming and yelling. I found out she wasn't from New York  she's not an American  doesn't know anybody here. I asked   Do you always get angry   She said   Yes.  Guilty people got guilty  sad people got sad. I took these two men and I did an indirect negotiation. Jewish man with family in the occupied territory  someone in New York who would have died if he was at work that day  and this man who wanted to be a terrorist  and I made it very clear. This integration is on a film  which I'd be happy to send you  instead of my verbalization  but the two of them not only came together and changed their beliefs and models of the world  but worked together to bring  for almost four years now  through various mosques and synagogues  the idea of how to create peace. And he wrote a book  called  My Jihad  My Way of Peace.  So  transformation can happen. My invitation to you is  explore your web  the web in here    the needs  the beliefs  the emotions that are controlling you  for two reasons  so there's more of you to give  and achieve  too  but I mean give  because that's what's going to fill you up. And secondly  so you can appreciate    not just understand  that's intellectual  that's the mind  but appreciate what's driving other people. It's the only way our world's going to change. God bless you  thank you. I hope this was of service.
Joshua Prince-Ramus,Behind the design of Seattle's library,Jul 2006,1062,I'm going to present three projects in rapid fire. I don't have much time to do it. And I want to reinforce three ideas with that rapid fire presentation. The first is what I like to call a hyper rational process. It's a process that takes rationality almost to an absurd level  and it transcends all the baggage that normally comes with what people would call  sort of a rational conclusion to something. And it concludes in something that you see here  that you actually wouldn't expect as being the result of rationality. The second    the second is that this process does not have a signature. There is no authorship. Architects are obsessed with authorship. This is something that has editing and it has teams  but in fact  we no longer see within this process  the traditional master architect creating a sketch that his minions carry out. And the third is that it challenges    and this is  in the length of this  very hard to support why  connect all these things    but it challenges the high modernist notion of flexibility. High modernists said we will create sort of singular spaces that are generic  almost anything can happen within them. I call it sort of  shotgun flexibility     turn your head this way  shoot  and you're bound to kill something. So  this is the promise of high modernism  within a single space  actually  any kind of activity can happen. But as we're seeing  operational costs are starting to dwarf capital costs in terms of design parameters. And so  with this sort of idea  what happens is  whatever actually is in the building on opening day  or whatever seems to be the most immediate need  starts to dwarf the possibility and sort of subsume it  of anything else could ever happen. And so we're proposing a different kind of flexibility  something that we call  compartmentalized flexibility.  And the idea is that you  within that continuum  identify a series of points  and you design specifically to them. They can be pushed off center a little bit  but in the end you actually still get as much of that original spectrum as you originally had hoped. With high modernist flexibility  that doesn't really work. Now I'm going to talk about    I'm going to build up the Seattle Central Library in this way before your eyes in about five or six diagrams  and I truly mean this is the design process that you'll see. With the library staff and the library board  we settled on two core positions. This is the first one  and this is showing  over the last     years  the evolution of the book  and other technologies. This diagram was our sort of position piece about the book  and our position was  books are technology    that's something people forget    but it's a form of technology that will have to share its dominance with any other form of truly potent technology or media. The second premise    and this was something that was very difficult for us to convince the librarians of at first    is that libraries  since the inception of Carnegie Library tradition in America  had a second responsibility  and that was for social roles. Ok  now  this I'll come back to later  but something    actually  the librarians at first said   No  this isn't our mandate. Our mandate is media  and particularly the book.  So what you're seeing now is actually the design of the building. The upper diagram is what we had seen in a whole host of contemporary libraries that used high modernist flexibility. Sort of  any activity could happen anywhere. We don't know the future of the library  we don't know the future of the book  and so  we'll use this approach. And what we saw were buildings that were very generic  and worse    not only were they very generic    so  not only does the reading room look like the copy room look like the magazine area    but it meant that whatever issue was troubling the library at that moment was starting to engulf every other activity that was happening in it. And in this case  what was getting engulfed were these social responsibilities by the expansion of the book. And so we proposed what's at the lower diagram. Very dumb approach  simply compartmentalize. Put those things whose evolution we could predict    and I don't mean that we could say what would actually happen in the future  but we have some certainty of the spectrum of what would happen in the future    put those in boxes designed specifically for it  and put the things that we can't predict on the rooftops. So that was the core idea. Now  we had to convince the library that social roles were equally important to media  in order to get them to accept this. What you're seeing here is actually their program on the left. That's as it was given to us in all of its clarity and glory. Our first operation was to re digest it back to them  show it to them and say   You know what  We haven't touched it  but only one third of your own program is dedicated to media and books. Two thirds of it is already dedicated    that's the white band below  the thing you said isn't important    is already dedicated to social functions.  So once we had presented that back to them  they agreed that this sort of core concept could work. We got the right to go back to first principles    that's the third diagram. We recombined everything. And then we started making new decisions. What you're seeing on the right is the design of the library  specifically in terms of square footage. On the left of that diagram  here  you'll see a series of five platforms    sort of combs  collective programs. And on the right are the more indeterminate spaces  things like reading rooms  whose evolution in            years we can't predict. So that literally was the design of the building. They signed it  and to their chagrin  we came back a week later  and we presented them this. And as you can see  it is literally the diagram on the right. We just sized    no  really  I mean that  literally. The things on the left hand side of the diagram  those are the boxes. We sized them into five compartments. They're super efficient. We had a very low budget to work with. We pushed them around on the site to make very literal contextual relationships. The reading room should be able to see the water. The main entrance should have a public plaza in front of it to abide by the zoning code  and so forth. So  you see the five platforms  those are the boxes. within each one  a very discrete thing is happening. The area in between is sort of an urban continuum  these things that we can't predict their evolution to the same degree. To give you some sense of the power of this idea  the biggest block is what we call the book spiral. It's literally built in a very inexpensive way    it is a parking garage for books. It just so happens to be on the  th through   th floors of the building  but that is not necessarily an expensive approach. And it allows us to organize the entire Dewey Decimal System on one continuous run  no matter how it grows or contracts within the building  it will always have its clarity to end the sort of trail of tears that we've all experienced in public libraries. And so this was the final operation  which was to take these blocks as they were all pushed off kilter  and to hold onto them with a skin. That skin serves double duty  again  for economics. One  it is the lateral stability for the entire building  it's a structural element. But its dimensions were designed not only for structure  but also for holding on every piece of glass. The glass was then    I'll use the word impregnated    but it had a layer of metal that was called  stretched metal.  That metal acts as a microlouver  so from the exterior of the building  the sun sees it as totally opaque  but from the interior  it's entirely transparent. So now I'm going to take you on a tour of the building. Let me see if I can find it. For anyone who gets motion sickness  I apologize. So  this is the building. And I think what's important is  when we first unveiled the building  the public saw it as being totally about our whim and ego. And it was defended  believe it or not  by the librarians. They said   Look  we don't know what it is  but we know it's everything that we need it to be  based on the observations that we've done about the program.  This is going into one of the entries. So  it's an unusual building for a public library  obviously. So now we're going into what we call the living room. This is actually a program that we invented with the library. It was recognizing that public libraries are the last vestige of public free space. There are plenty of shopping malls that allow you to get out of the rain in downtown Seattle  but there are not so many free places that allow you to get out of the rain. So this was an unprogrammed area where people could pretty much do anything  including eat  yell  play chess and so forth. Now we're moving up into what we call the mixing chamber. That was the main technology area in the building. You'll have to tell me if I'm going too fast for you. And now up. This is actually the place that we put into the building so I could propose to my wife  right there. She said yes. I'm running out of time  so I'm actually going to stop. I can show this to you later. But let's see if I can very quickly get into the book spiral  because I think it's  as I said  the most    this is the main reading room    the most unique part of the building. You dizzy yet  Ok  so here  this is the book spiral. So  it's very indiscernible  but it's actually a continuous stair stepping. It allows you to  on one city block  go up one full floor  so that it's on a continuum. Ok  now I'm going to go back  and I'm going to hit a second project. I'm going to go very  very quickly through this. Now this is the Dallas Theater. It was an unusual client for us  because they came to us and they said   We need you to do a new building. We've been working in a temporary space for    years  but because of that temporary space  we've become an infamous theater company. Theater is really focused in New York  Chicago and Seattle  with the exception of the Dallas Theater Company.  And the very fact that they worked in a provisional space meant that for Beckett  they could blow out a wall  they could do  Cherry Orchard  and blow a hole through the floor  and so forth. So it was a very daunting task for us to do a brand new building that could be a pristine building  but keep this kind of experimental nature. And the second is  they were what we call a multi form theater  they do different kinds of performances in repertory. So they in the morning will do something in arena  then they'll do something in proscenium and so forth. And so they needed to be able to quickly transform between different theater organizations  and for operational budget reasons  this actually no longer happens in pretty much any multi form theater in the United States  so we needed to figure out a way to overcome that. So our thought was to literally put the theater on its head  to take those things that were previously defined as front of house and back of house and stack them above house and below house  and to create what we called a theater machine. We invest the money in the operation of the building. It's almost as though the building could be placed anywhere  wherever you place it  the area under it is charged for theatrical performances. And it allowed us to go back to first principles  and redefine fly tower  acoustic enclosure  light enclosure and so forth. And at the push of a button  it allows the artistic director to move between proscenium  thrust  and in fact  arena and traverse and flat floor  in a very quick transfiguration. So in fact  using operational budget  we can    sorry  capital cost    we can actually achieve what was no longer achievable in operational cost. And that means that the artistic director now has a palette that he or she can choose from  between a series of forms and a series of processions  because that enclosure around the theater that is normally trapped with front of house and back of house spaces has been liberated. So an artistic director has the ability to have a performance that enters in a Wagnerian procession  shows the first act in thrust  the intermission in a Greek procession  second act in arena  and so forth. So I'm going to show you what this actually means. This is the theater up close. Any portion around the theater actually can be opened discretely. The light enclosure can be lifted separate to the acoustic enclosure  so you can do Beckett with Dallas as the backdrop. Portions can be opened  so you can now actually have motorcycles drive directly into the performance  or you can even just have an open air performance  or for intermissions. The balconies all move to go between those configurations  but they also disappear. The proscenium line can also disappear. You can bring enormous objects in  so in fact  the Dallas Theater Company    their first show will be a play about Charles Lindbergh  and they'll want to bring in a real aircraft. And then it also provides them  in the off season  the ability to actually rent out their space for entirely different things. This is it from a distance. Open up entire portions for different kinds of events. And at night. Again  remove the light enclosure  keep the acoustic enclosure. This is a monster truck show. I'm going to show now the last project. This also is an unusual client. They inverted the whole idea of development. They came to us and they said    unlike normal developers    they said   We want to start out by providing a contemporary art museum in Louisville. That's our main goal.  And so instead of being a developer that sees an opportunity to make money  they saw an ability to be a catalyst in their downtown. And the fact that they wanted to support the contemporary art museum actually built their pro forma  so they worked in reverse. And that pro forma led us to a mixed use building that was very large  in order to support their aspirations of the art  but it also opened up opportunities for the art itself to collaborate  interact with commercial spaces that actually artists more and more want to work within. And it also charged us with thinking about how to have something that was both a single building and a credible sort of sub building. So this is Louisville's skyline  and I'm going to take you through the various constraints that led to the project. First  the physical constraints. We actually had to operate on three discrete sites  all of them well smaller than the size of the building. We had to operate next to the new Muhammad Ali Center  and respect it. We had to operate within the     year floodplain. Now  this area floods three to four times a year  and there's a levee behind our site  similar to the ones that broke in New Orleans. Had to operate behind the I    corridor  a street that cuts through the middle of these separate sites. So we're starting to build a sort of nightmare of constraints in a bathtub. Underneath the bathtub are the city's main power lines. And there is a pedestrian corridor that they wanted to add  that would link a series of cultural buildings  and a view corridor    because this is the historic district    that they didn't want to obstruct with a new building. And now we're going to add  .  million square feet. And if we did the traditional thing  that  .  million square feet    these are the different programs    the traditional thing would be to identify the public elements  place them on sites  and now we'd have a really terrible situation  a public thing in the middle of a bathtub that floods. And then we would size all the other elements    the different commercial elements  hotel  luxury housing  offices and so forth    and dump it on top. And we would create something that was unviable. In fact    and you know this    this is called the Time Warner Building. So our strategy was very simple. Just lift the entire block  flip some of the elements over  reposition them so they have appropriate views and relationships to downtown  and make circulation connections and reroute the road. So that's the basic concept  and now I'm going to show you what it leads to. Ok  it seems a very formal  willful gesture  but something derived entirely out of the constraints. And again  when we unveiled it  there was a sort of nervousness that this was about an architect making a statement  not an architect who was attempting to solve a series of problems. Now  within that center zone  as I said  we have the ability to mix a series of things. So here  this is sort of an x ray    the towers are totally developer driven. They told us the dimensions  the sizes and so forth  and we focused on taking all the public components    the lobbies  the bars    everything that different commercial elements would have  and combined it in the center  in the sort of subway map  in the transfer zone that would also include the contemporary art museum. So it creates a situation like this  where you have artists who can operate within an art space that also has an amazing view on the   nd floor  but it also has proximity that the curator can either open or close. It allows people on exercise bicycles to be seen  or to see the art  and so forth. It also means that if an artist wants to invade something like a swimming pool  they can begin to do their exhibition in a swimming pool  so they're not forced to always work within the confines of a contemporary gallery space. So  how to build this. It's very simple  it's a chair. So  we begin by building the cores. As we're building the cores  we build the contemporary art museum at grade. That allows us to have incredible efficiency and cost efficiency. This is not a high budget building. The moment the cores get to mid level  we finish the art museum  we put all the mechanical equipment in it  and then we jack it up into the air. This is how they build really large aircraft hangars  for instance  the ones that they did for the A   . Finish the cores  finish the meat and you get something that looks like this. Now I only have about    seconds  so I want to start an animation  and we'll conclude with that. Thank you. Chris asked me to add    the theater is under construction  and this project will start construction in about a year  and finish in     .  identify public elements   insert public elements at grade   optimize tower dimensions   place towers on site   lift program   flip    optimize program adjacencies   connect to context   redirect  th street 
Julia Sweeney,Letting go of God,Jul 2006,936,On September     the morning of my seventh birthday  I came downstairs to the kitchen  where my mother was washing the dishes and my father was reading the paper or something  and I sort of presented myself to them in the doorway  and they said   Hey  happy birthday   And I said   I'm seven.  And my father smiled and said   Well  you know what that means  don't you   And I said   Yeah  that I'm going to have a party and a cake and get a lot of presents   And my dad said   Well  yes. But more importantly  being seven means that you've reached the age of reason  and you're now capable of committing any and all sins against God and man.  Now  I had heard this phrase   age of reason   before. Sister Mary Kevin had been bandying it about my second grade class at school. But when she said it  the phrase seemed all caught up in the excitement of preparations for our first communion and our first confession  and everybody knew that was really all about the white dress and the white veil. And anyway  I hadn't really paid all that much attention to that phrase   age of reason.  So  I said   Yeah  yeah  age of reason. What does that mean again   And my dad said   Well  we believe  in the Catholic Church  that God knows that little kids don't know the difference between right and wrong  but when you're seven  you're old enough to know better. So  you've grown up and reached the age of reason  and now God will start keeping notes on you  and begin your permanent record.  And I said   Oh ... Wait a minute. You mean all that time  up till today  all that time I was so good  God didn't notice it   And my mom said   Well  I noticed it.  And I thought   How could I not have known this before  How could it not have sunk in when they'd been telling me  All that being good and no real credit for it. And worst of all  how could I not have realized this very important information until the very day that it was basically useless to me   So I said   Well  Mom and Dad  what about Santa Claus  I mean  Santa Claus knows if you're naughty or nice  right   And my dad said   Yeah  but  honey  I think that's technically just between Thanksgiving and Christmas.  And my mother said   Oh  Bob  stop it. Let's just tell her. I mean  she's seven. Julie  there is no Santa Claus.  Now  this was actually not that upsetting to me. My parents had this whole elaborate story about Santa Claus  how they had talked to Santa Claus himself and agreed that instead of Santa delivering our presents over the night of Christmas Eve  like he did for every other family who got to open their surprises first thing Christmas morning  our family would give Santa more time. Santa would come to our house while we were at nine o'clock high mass on Christmas morning  but only if all of us kids did not make a fuss. Which made me very suspicious. It was pretty obvious that it was really our parents giving us the presents. I mean  my dad had a very distinctive wrapping style  and my mother's handwriting was so close to Santa's. Plus  why would Santa save time by having to loop back to our house after he'd gone to everybody else's  There was only one obvious conclusion to reach from this mountain of evidence  our family was too strange and weird for even Santa Claus to come visit  and my poor parents were trying to protect us from the embarrassment  this humiliation of rejection by Santa  who was jolly    but let's face it  he was also very judgmental. So to find out that there was no Santa Claus at all was actually sort of a relief. I left the kitchen not really in shock about Santa  but rather  I was just dumbfounded about how I could have missed this whole age of reason thing. It was too late for me  but maybe I could help someone else  someone who could use the information. They had to fit two criteria  they had to be old enough to be able to understand the whole concept of the age of reason  and not yet seven. The answer was clear  my brother Bill. He was six. Well  I finally found Bill about a block away from our house at this public school playground. It was a Saturday  and he was all by himself  just kicking a ball against the side of a wall. I ran up to him and said   Bill  I just realized that the age of reason starts when you turn seven  and then you're capable of committing any and all sins against God and man.  And Bill said   So   And I said   So  you're six. You have a whole year to do anything you want to and God won't notice it.  And he said   So   And I said   So  So everything   And I turned to run. I was so angry with him. But when I got to the top of the steps  I turned around dramatically and said   Oh  by the way  Bill    there is no Santa Claus.  Now  I didn't know it at the time  but I really wasn't turning seven on September   th. For my   th birthday  I planned a slumber party with all of my girlfriends  but a couple of weeks beforehand my mother took me aside and said   I need to speak to you privately. September   th is not your birthday. It's October   th.  And I said   What   And she said ...  Listen. The cut off date to start kindergarten was September   th.   So I told them that your birthday was September   th  and then I wasn't sure that you weren't just going to go blab it all over the place  so I started to tell you your birthday was September   th. But  Julie  you were so ready to start school  honey. You were so ready.  I thought about it  and when I was four  I was already the oldest of four children  and my mother even had another child to come  so what I think she    understandably    really meant was that she was so ready  she was so ready. Then she said   Don't worry  Julie. Every year on October   th  when it was your birthday but you didn't realize it  I made sure that you ate a piece of cake that day.  Which was comforting  but troubling. My mother had been celebrating my birthday with me  without me. What was so upsetting about this new piece of information was not that I had to change the date of my slumber party with all of my girlfriends. What was most upsetting was that this meant I was not a Virgo. I had a huge Virgo poster in my bedroom. And I read my horoscope every single day  and it was so totally me. And this meant that I was a Libra  So  I took the bus downtown to get the new Libra poster. The Virgo poster is a picture of a beautiful woman with long hair  sort of lounging by some water  but the Libra poster is just a huge scale. This was around the time that I started filling out physically  and I was filling out a lot more than a lot of the other girls  and frankly  the whole idea that my astrological sign was a scale just seemed ominous and depressing. But I got the new Libra poster  and I started to read my new Libra horoscope  and I was astonished to find that it was also totally me. It wasn't until years later  looking back on this whole age of reason  change of birthday thing  that it dawned on me  I wasn't turning seven when I thought I turned seven. I had a whole other month to do anything I wanted to before God started keeping tabs on me. Oh  life can be so cruel. One day  two Mormon missionaries came to my door. Now  I just live off a main thoroughfare in Los Angeles  and my block is    well  it's a natural beginning for people who are peddling things door to door. Sometimes I get little old ladies from the Seventh Day Adventist Church showing me these cartoon pictures of heaven. And sometimes I get teenagers who promise me that they won't join a gang and just start robbing people  if I only buy some magazine subscriptions from them. So normally  I just ignore the doorbell  but on this day  I answered. And there stood two boys  each about     in white  starched short sleeved shirts  and they had little name tags that identified them as official representatives of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints  and they said they had a message for me  from God. I said   A message for me  From God   And they said   Yes.  Now  I was raised in the Pacific Northwest  around a lot of Church of Latter day Saints people and  you know  I've worked with them and even dated them  but I never really knew the doctrine  or what they said to people when they were out on a mission  and I guess I was sort of curious  so I said   Well  please  come in.  And they looked really happy  because I don't think this happens to them all that often. And I sat them down  and I got them glasses of water    Ok  I got it  I got it. I got them glasses of water. Don't touch my hair  that's the thing. You can't put a video of myself in front of me and expect me not to fix my hair. Ok. So I sat them down and I got them glasses of water  and after niceties  they said   Do you believe that God loves you with all his heart   And I thought   Well  of course I believe in God  but you know  I don't like that word 'heart ' because it anthropomorphizes God  and I don't like the word  'his ' either  because that sexualizes God.  But I didn't want to argue semantics with these boys  so after a very long  uncomfortable pause  I said   Yes  yes  I do. I feel very loved.  And they looked at each other and smiled  like that was the right answer. And then they said   Do you believe that we're all brothers and sisters on this planet   And I said   Yes  I do.  And I was so relieved that it was a question I could answer so quickly. And they said   Well  then we have a story to tell you.  And they told me this story all about this guy named Lehi  who lived in Jerusalem in     BC. Now  apparently in Jerusalem in     BC  everyone was completely bad and evil. Every single one of them  man  woman  child  infant  fetus. And God came to Lehi and said to him   Put your family on a boat and I will lead you out of here.  And God did lead them. He led them to America. I said   America  From Jerusalem to America by boat in     BC   And they said   Yes.  Then they told me how Lehi and his descendants reproduced and reproduced  and over the course of     years  there were two great races of them  the Nephites and the Lamanites  and the Nephites were totally good    each and every one of them    and the Lamanites were totally bad and evil    every single one of them just bad to the bone. Then  after Jesus died on the cross for our sins  on his way up to heaven  he stopped by America and visited the Nephites. And he told them that if they all remained totally  totally good    each and every one of them    they would win the war against the evil Lamanites. But apparently somebody blew it  because the Lamanites were able to kill all the Nephites. All but one guy  this guy named Mormon  who managed to survive by hiding in the woods. And he made sure this whole story was written down in reformed Egyptian hieroglyphics chiseled onto gold plates  which he then buried near Palmyra  New York. Well  I was just on the edge of my seat. I said   What happened to the Lamanites   And they said   Well  they became our Native Americans  here in the U.S.  And I said   So  you believe the Native Americans are descended from a people who were totally evil   And they said   Yes.  Then they told me how this guy named Joseph Smith found those buried gold plates right in his backyard  and he also found this magic stone back there that he put into his hat and then buried his face into  and this allowed him to translate the gold plates from the reformed Egyptian into English. Well  at this point I just wanted to give these two boys some advice about their pitch. I wanted to say     Ok  don't start with this story.  I mean  even the Scientologists know to start with a personality test before they start    telling people all about Xenu  the evil intergalactic overlord. Then  they said   Do you believe that God speaks to us through his righteous prophets   And I said   No  I don't   because I was sort of upset about this Lamanite story and this crazy gold plate story  but the truth was  I hadn't really thought this through  so I backpedaled a little and I said   Well  what exactly do you mean by 'righteous'  And what do you mean by prophets  Like  could the prophets be women   And they said   No.  And I said   Why   And they said   Well  it's because God gave women a gift that is so spectacular  it is so wonderful  that the only gift he had left over to give men was the gift of prophecy.  What is this wonderful gift God gave women  I wondered  Maybe their greater ability to cooperate and adapt  Women's longer lifespan  The fact that women tend to be much less violent than men  But no    it wasn't any of these gifts. They said   Well  it's her ability to bear children.  I said   Oh  come on. I mean  even if women tried to have a baby every single year from the time they were    to the time they were     assuming they didn't die from exhaustion  it still seems like some women would have some time left over to hear the word of God.  And they said   No.  Well  then they didn't look so fresh faced and cute to me any more  but they had more to say. They said   Well  we also believe that if you're a Mormon  and if you're in good standing with the church  when you die  you get to go to heaven and be with your family for all eternity.  And I said   Oh  dear. That wouldn't be such a good incentive for me.  And they said   Oh. Hey  Well  we also believe that when you go to heaven  you get your body restored to you in its best original state. Like  if you'd lost a leg  well  you get it back. Or  if you'd gone blind  you could see.  I said   Oh. Now  I don't have a uterus  because I had cancer a few years ago. So does this mean that if I went to heaven  I would get my old uterus back   And they said   Sure.  And I said   I don't want it back. I'm happy without it.  Gosh. What if you had a nose job and you liked it  Would God force you to get your old nose back  Then they gave me this Book of Mormon  told me to read this chapter and that chapter  and said they'd come back and check in on me  and I think I said something like   Please don't hurry   or maybe just   Please don't   and they were gone. Ok  so I initially felt really superior to these boys  and smug in my more conventional faith. But then the more I thought about it  the more I had to be honest with myself. If someone came to my door and I was hearing Catholic theology and dogma for the very first time  and they said   We believe that God impregnated a very young girl without the use of intercourse  and the fact that she was a virgin is maniacally important to us.   And she had a baby  and that's the son of God   I mean  I would think that's equally ridiculous. I'm just so used to that story. So  I couldn't let myself feel condescending towards these boys. But the question they asked me when they first arrived really stuck in my head  Did I believe that God loved me with all his heart  Because I wasn't exactly sure how I felt about that question. Now  if they had asked me   Do you feel that God loves you with all his heart   Well  that would have been much different  I think I would have instantly answered   Yes  yes  I feel it all the time. I feel God's love when I'm hurt and confused  and I feel consoled and cared for. I take shelter in God's love when I don't understand why tragedy hits  and I feel God's love when I look with gratitude at all the beauty I see.  But since they asked me that question with the word  believe  in it  somehow it was all different  because I wasn't exactly sure if I believed what I so clearly felt.
Rick Warren,A life of purpose,Jul 2006,1254,I'm often asked   What surprised you about the book   And I say   That I got to write it.  I would have never imagined that. Not in my wildest dreams did I think    I don't even consider myself to be an author. And I'm often asked   Why do you think so many people have read this  This thing's selling still about a million copies a month.  And I think it's because spiritual emptiness is a universal disease. I think inside at some point  we put our heads down on the pillow and we go   There's got to be more to life than this.  Get up in the morning  go to work  come home and watch TV  go to bed  get up in the morning  go to work  come home  watch TV  go to bed  go to parties on weekends. A lot of people say   I'm living.  No  you're not living    that's just existing. Just existing. I really think that there's this inner desire. I do believe what Chris said  I believe that you're not an accident. Your parents may not have planned you  but I believe God did. I think there are accidental parents  there's no doubt about that. I don't think there are accidental kids. And I think you matter. I think you matter to God  I think you matter to history  I think you matter to this universe. And I think that the difference between what I call the survival level of living  the success level of living  and the significance level of living is  Do you figure out   What on Earth am I here for   I meet a lot of people who are very smart  and say   But why can't I figure out my problems   And I meet a lot of people who are very successful  who say   Why don't I feel more fulfilled  Why do I feel like a fake  Why do I feel like I've got to pretend that I'm more than I really am   I think that comes down to this issue of meaning  of significance  of purpose. I think it comes down to this issue of   Why am I here  What am I here for  Where am I going   These are not religious issues. They're human issues. I wanted to tell Michael before he spoke that I really appreciate what he does  because it makes my life work a whole lot easier. As a pastor  I do see a lot of kooks. And I have learned that there are kooks in every area of life. Religion doesn't have a monopoly on that  but there are plenty of religious kooks. There are secular kooks  there are smart kooks  dumb kooks. There are people    a lady came up to me the other day  and she had a white piece of paper    Michael  you'll like this one    and she said   What do you see in it   And I looked at it and I said   Oh  I don't see anything.  And she goes   Well  I see Jesus   and started crying and left. I'm going   OK   you know   Fine.  Good for you. When the book became the best selling book in the world for the last three years  I kind of had my little crisis. And that was  What is the purpose of this  Because it brought in enormous amounts of money. When you write the best selling book in the world  it's tons and tons of money. And it brought in a lot of attention  neither of which I wanted. When I started Saddleback Church  I was    years old. I started it with one other family in     . And I decided that I was never going to go on TV  because I didn't want to be a celebrity. I didn't want to be a  quote   evangelist  televangelist     that's not my thing. And all of the sudden  it brought a lot of money and a lot of attention. I don't think    now  this is a worldview  and I will tell you  everybody's got a worldview. Everybody's betting their life on something. You're betting your life on something  you just better know why you're betting what you're betting on. So  everybody's betting their life on something. And when I  you know  made a bet  I happened to believe that Jesus was who he said he was. And I believe in a pluralistic society  everybody's betting on something. And when I started the church  you know  I had no plans to do what it's doing now. And then when I wrote this book  and all of a sudden  it just took off  and I started saying  now  what's the purpose of this  Because as I started to say  I don't think you're given money or fame for your own ego  ever. I just don't believe that. And when you write a book that the first sentence of the book is   It's not about you   then  when all of a sudden it becomes the best selling book in history  you've got to figure  well  I guess it's not about me. That's kind of a no brainer. So  what is it for  And I began to think about what I call the  stewardship of affluence  and the  stewardship of influence.  So I believe  essentially  leadership is stewardship. That if you are a leader in any area    in business  in politics  in sports  in art  in academics  in any area    you don't own it. You are a steward of it. For instance  that's why I believe in protecting the environment. This is not my planet. It wasn't mine before I was born  it's not going to be mine after I die  I'm just here for    years and then that's it. I was debating the other day on a talk show  and the guy was challenging me and he'd go   What's a pastor doing on protecting the environment   And I asked this guy  I said   Well  do you believe that human beings are responsible to make the world a little bit better place for the next generation  Do you think we have a stewardship here  to take the environment seriously   And he said   No.  I said   Oh  you don't   I said   Let me make this clear again  Do you believe that as human beings    I'm not talking about religion    do you believe that as human beings  it is our responsibility to take care of this planet  and make it just a little bit better for the next generation   And he said   No. Not any more than any other species.  When he said the word  species   he was revealing his worldview. And he was saying   I'm no more responsible to take care of this environment than a duck is.  Well now  I know a lot of times we act like ducks  but you're not a duck. You're not a duck. And you are responsible    that's my worldview. And so  you need to understand what your worldview is. The problem is most people never really think it through. They never really ... codify it or qualify it or quantify it  and say   This is what I believe in. This is why I believe what I believe.  I don't personally have enough faith to be an atheist. But you may  you may. Your worldview  though  does determine everything else in your life  because it determines your decisions  it determines your relationships  it determines your level of confidence. It determines  really  everything in your life. What we believe  obviously    and you know this    determines our behavior  and our behavior determines what we become in life. So all of this money started pouring in  and all of this fame started pouring in. And I'm going  what do I do with this  My wife and I first made five decisions on what to do with the money. We said   First  we're not going to use it on ourselves.  I didn't go out and buy a bigger house. I don't own a guesthouse. I still drive the same four year old Ford that I've driven. We just said  we're not going to use it on us. The second thing was  I stopped taking a salary from the church that I pastor. Third thing is  I added up all that the church had paid me over the last    years  and I gave it back. And I gave it back because I didn't want anybody thinking that I do what I do for money    I don't. In fact  personally  I've never met a priest or a pastor or a minister who does it for money. I know that's the stereotype  I've never met one of them. Believe me  there's a whole lot easier ways to make money. Pastors are like on    hours a day call  they're like doctors. I left late today    I'd hoped to be here yesterday    because my father in law is in his last  probably     hours before he dies of cancer. And I'm watching a guy who's lived his life    he's now in his mid   s    and he's dying with peace. You know  the test of your worldview is not how you act in the good times. The test of your worldview is how you act at the funeral. And having been through literally hundreds if not thousands of funerals  it makes a difference. It makes a difference what you believe. So  we gave it all back  and then we set up three foundations  working on some of the major problems of the world  illiteracy  poverty  pandemic diseases    particularly HIV AIDS    and set up these three foundations  and put the money into that. The last thing we did is we became what I call  reverse tithers.  And that is  when my wife and I got married    years ago  we started tithing. Now  that's a principle in the Bible that says give    percent of what you get back to charity  give it away to help other people. So  we started doing that  and each year we would raise our tithe one percent. So  our first year of marriage we went to    percent  second year we went to    percent  and the third year we went to    percent  and on and on and on. Why did I do that  Because every time I give  it breaks the grip of materialism in my life. Materialism is all about getting    get  get  get  get all you can  can all you get  sit on the can and spoil the rest. It's all about more  having more. And we think that the good life is actually looking good    that's most important of all    looking good  feeling good and having the goods. But that's not the good life. I meet people all the time who have those  and they're not necessarily happy. If money actually made you happy  then the wealthiest people in the world would be the happiest. And that I know  personally  I know  is not true. It's just not true. So  the good life is not about looking good  feeling good or having the goods  it's about being good and doing good. Giving your life away. Significance in life doesn't come from status  because you can always find somebody who's got more than you. It doesn't come from sex. It doesn't come from salary. It comes from serving. It is in giving our lives away that we find meaning  we find significance. That's the way we were wired  I believe  by God. And so we began to give away  and now after    years  my wife and I are reverse tithers    we give away    percent and live on   . That  actually  was the easy part. The hard part is  what do I do with all this attention  Because I started getting all kinds of invitations. I just came off a nearly month long speaking tour on three different continents  and I won't go into that  but it was an amazing thing. And I'm going  what do I do with this notoriety that the book has brought  And  being a pastor  I started reading the Bible. There's a chapter in the Bible called Psalm     and it's Solomon's prayer for more influence. When you read this prayer  it sounds incredibly selfish  self centered. He says   God  I want you to make me famous.  That's what he prays. He said   I want you to make me famous. I want you to spread the fame of my name through every land  I want you to give me power. I want you to make me famous  I want you to give me influence.  And it just sounds like the most egotistical request you could make  if you were going to pray. Until you read the whole psalm  the whole chapter. And then he says   So that the king ...     he was the king of Israel at that time  at its apex in power     ... so that the king may care for the widow and orphan  support the oppressed  defend the defenseless  care for the sick  assist the poor  speak up for the foreigner  those in prison.  Basically  he's talking about all the marginalized in society. And as I read that  I looked at it  and I thought  you know  what this is saying is that the purpose of influence is to speak up for those who have no influence. The purpose of influence is not to build your ego. Or your net worth. And  by the way  your net worth is not the same thing as your self worth. Your value is not based on your valuables. It's based on a whole different set of things. And so the purpose of influence is to speak up for those who have no influence. And I had to admit  I can't think of the last time I thought of widows and orphans. They're not on my radar. I pastor a church in one of the most affluent areas of America    a bunch of gated communities. I have a church full of CEOs and scientists. And I could go five years and never  ever see a homeless person. They're just not in my pathway. Now  they're    miles up the road in Santa Ana. So I had to say  ok  I would use whatever affluence and whatever influence I've got to help those who don't have either of those. You know  there's a story in the Bible about Moses  whether you believe it's true or not  it really doesn't matter to me. But Moses  if you saw the movie   The Ten Commandments   Moses goes out  and there's this burning bush  and God talks to him  and God says   Moses  what's in your hand   I think that's one of the most important questions you'll ever be asked  What's in your hand  Moses says   It's a staff. It's a shepherd's staff.  And God says   Throw it down.  And if you saw the movie  you know  he throws it down and it becomes a snake. And then God says   Pick it up.  And he picks it back up again  and it becomes a staff again. Now  I'm reading this thing  and I'm going  what is that all about  OK. What's that all about  Well  I do know a couple of things. Number one  God never does a miracle to show off. It's not just   Wow  isn't that cool   And  by the way  my God doesn't have to show up on cheese bread. You know  if God's going to show up  he's not going to show up on cheese bread. Ok  I just  this is why I love what Michael does  because it's like  if he's debunking it  then I don't have to. But God    my God    doesn't show up on sprinkler images. He's got a few more powerful ways than that to do whatever he wants to do. But he doesn't do miracles just to show off. Second thing is  if God ever asks you a question  he already knows the answer. Obviously  if he's God  then that would mean that when he asks the question  it's for your benefit  not his. So he's going   What's in your hand   Now  what was in Moses' hand  Well  it was a shepherd's staff. Now  follow me on this. This staff represented three things about Moses' life. First  it represented his identity  he was a shepherd. It's the symbol of his own occupation  I am a shepherd. It's a symbol of his identity  his career  his job. Second  it's a symbol of not only his identity  it's a symbol of his income  because all of his assets are tied up in sheep. In those days  nobody had bank accounts  or American Express cards  or hedge funds. Your assets are tied up in your flocks. So it's a symbol of his identity  and it's a symbol of his income. And the third thing  it's a symbol of his influence. What do you do with a shepherd's staff  Well  you know  you move sheep from point A to point B with it  by hook or by crook. You pull them or you poke them. One or the other. So  he's saying   You're going to lay down your identity. What's in your hand  You've got identity  you've got income  you've got influence. What's in your hand   And he's saying   If you lay it down  I'll make it come alive. I'll do some things you could never imagine possible.  And if you've watched that movie   Ten Commandments   all of those big miracles that happen in Egypt are done through this staff. Last year  I was invited to speak at the NBA All Stars game. And so  I'm talking to the players  because most of the NBA teams  NFL teams and all the other teams have done this    Days of Purpose  based on the book. And I asked them  I said   What's in your hand  So  what's in your hand   I said   It's a basketball. And that basketball represents your identity  who you are  you're an NBA player. It represents your income  you're making a lot of money off that little ball. And it represents your influence. And even though you're only going to be in the NBA for a few years  you're going to be an NBA player for the rest of your life. And that gives you enormous influence. So  what are you going to do with what you've been given   And I guess that's the main reason I came up here today  to all of you very bright people at TED    it is to say   What's in your hand   What do you have that you've been given  Talent  background  education  freedom  networks  opportunities  wealth  ideas  creativity. What are you doing with what you've been given  That  to me  is the primary question about life. That  to me  is what being purpose driven is all about. In the book  I talk about how you're wired to do certain things  you're  SHAPED  with    a little acrostic  Spiritual gifts  Heart  Ability  Personality and Experiences. These things shape you. And if you want to know what you ought to be doing with your life  you need to look at your shape     What am I wired to do   Why would God wire you to do something and then not have you do it  If you're wired to be an anthropologist  you'll be an anthropologist. If you're wired to be an undersea explorer  you'll be an undersea explorer. If you're wired to make deals  you make deals. If you're wired to paint  you paint. Did you know that God smiles when you be you  When my little kids    when my kids were little    they're all grown now  I have grandkids    I used to go in and sit on the side of their bed  and I used to watch my kids sleep. And I just watched their little bodies rise and lower  rise and lower. And I would look at them   This is not an accident.  Rise and lower. And I got joy out of just watching them sleep. Some people have the misguided idea that God only gets excited when you're doing  quote   spiritual things   like going to church or helping the poor  or  you know  confessing or doing something like that. The bottom line is  God gets pleasure watching you be you. Why  He made you. And when you do what you were made to do  he goes   That's my boy  That's my girl  You're using the talent and ability that I gave you.  So my advice to you is  look at what's in your hand    your identity  your influence  your income    and say   It's not about me. It's about making the world a better place.  Thank you.
Dan Dennett,Let's teach religion — all religion — in schools,Jul 2006,1476,It's wonderful to be back. I love this wonderful gathering. And you must be wondering   What on earth  Have they put up the wrong slide   No  no. Look at this magnificent beast  and ask the question  Who designed it  This is TED  this is Technology  Entertainment  Design  and there's a dairy cow. It's a quite wonderfully designed animal. And I was thinking  how do I introduce this  And I thought  well  maybe that old doggerel by Joyce Kilmer  you know   Poems are made by fools like me  but only God can make a tree.  And you might say   Well  God designed the cow.  But  of course  God got a lot of help. This is the ancestor of cattle. This is the aurochs. And it was designed by natural selection  the process of natural selection  over many millions of years. And then it became domesticated  thousands of years ago. And human beings became its stewards  and  without even knowing what they were doing  they gradually redesigned it and redesigned it and redesigned it. And then more recently  they really began to do reverse engineering on this beast and figure out just what the parts were  how they worked and how they might be optimized    how they might be made better. Now  why am I talking about cows  Because I want to say that much the same thing is true of religions. Religions are natural phenomena    they're just as natural as cows. They have evolved over millennia. They have a biological base  just like the aurochs. They have become domesticated  and human beings have been redesigning their religions for thousands of years. This is TED  and I want to talk about design. Because what I've been doing for the last four years    really since the first time you saw me    some of you saw me at TED when I was talking about religion    and in the last four years  I've been working just about non stop on this topic. And you might say it's about the reverse engineering of religions. Now that very idea  I think  strikes terror in many people  or anger  or anxiety of one sort or another. And that is the spell that I want to break. I want to say  no  religions are an important natural phenomenon. We should study them with the same intensity that we study all the other important natural phenomena  like global warming  as we heard so eloquently last night from Al Gore. Today's religions are brilliantly designed    brilliantly designed. They are immensely powerful social institutions and many of their features can be traced back to earlier features that we can really make sense of by reverse engineering. And  as with the cow  there's a mixture of evolutionary design    designed by natural selection itself    and intelligent design    more or less intelligent design    and redesigned by human beings who are trying to redesign their religions. You don't do book talks at TED  but I'm going to have just one slide about my book  because there is one message in it which I think this group really needs to hear. And I would be very interested to get your responses to this. It's the one policy proposal that I make in the book  at this time  when I claim not to know enough about religion to know what other policy proposals to make. And it's one that echoes remarks that you've heard already today. Here's my proposal  I'm going to just take a couple of minutes to explain it  Education on world religions for all of our children    in primary school  in high school  in public schools  in private schools and in home schooling. So what I'm proposing is  just as we require reading  writing  arithmetic  American history  so we should have a curriculum on facts about all the religions of the world    about their history  about their creeds  about their texts  their music  their symbolisms  their prohibitions  their requirements. And this should be presented factually  straightforwardly  with no particular spin  to all of the children in the country. And as long as you teach them that  you can teach them anything else you like. That  I think  is maximal tolerance for religious freedom. As long as you inform your children about other religions  then you may    and as early as you like and whatever you like    teach them whatever creed you want them to learn. But also let them know about other religions. Now  why do I say that  Because democracy depends on an informed citizenship. Informed consent is the very bedrock of our understanding of democracy. Misinformed consent is not worth it. It's like a coin flip  it doesn't count  really. Democracy depends on informed consent. This is the way we treat people as responsible adults. Now  children below the age of consent are a special case. Parents    I'm going to use a word that Pastor Rick just used    parents are stewards of their children. They don't own them. You can't own your children. You have a responsibility to the world  to the state  to them  to take care of them right. You may teach them whatever creed you think is most important  but I say you have a responsibility to let them be informed about all the other creeds in the world  too. The reason I've taken this time is I've been fascinated to hear some of the reactions to this. One reviewer for a Roman Catholic newspaper called it  totalitarian.  It strikes me as practically libertarian. Is it totalitarian to require reading  writing and arithmetic  I don't think so. All I'm saying is    and facts  facts only  no values  just facts    about all the world's religions. Another reviewer called it  hilarious.  Well  I'm really bothered by the fact that anybody would think that was hilarious. It seems to me to be such a plausible  natural extension of the democratic principles we already have that I'm shocked to think anybody would find that just ridiculous. I know many religions are so anxious about preserving the purity of their faith among their children that they are intent on keeping their children ignorant of other faiths. I don't think that's defensible. But I'd really be pleased to get your answers on that    any reactions to that    later. But now I'm going to move on. Back to the cow. This picture  which I pulled off the web    the fellow on the left is really an important part of this picture. That's the steward. Cows couldn't live without human stewards    they're domesticated. They're a sort of ectosymbiont. They depend on us for their survival. And Pastor Rick was just talking about sheep. I'm going to talk about sheep  too. There's a lot of serendipitous convergence here. How clever it was of sheep to acquire shepherds  Think of what this got them. They could outsource all their problems  protection from predators  food finding ... ... health maintenance. The only cost in most flocks    not even this    a loss of free mating. What a deal   How clever of sheep   you might say. Except  of course  it wasn't the sheep's cleverness. We all know sheep are not exactly rocket scientists    they're not very smart. It wasn't the cleverness of the sheep at all. They were clueless. But it was a very clever move. Whose clever move was it  It was the clever move of natural selection itself. Francis Crick  the co discoverer of the structure of DNA with Jim Watson  once joked about what he called Orgel's Second Rule. Leslie Orgel is a molecular biologist  brilliant guy  and Orgel's Second Rule is  Evolution is cleverer than you are. Now  that is not Intelligent Design    not from Francis Crick. Evolution is cleverer than you are. If you understand Orgel's Second Rule  then you understand why the Intelligent Design movement is basically a hoax. The designs discovered by the process of natural selection are brilliant  unbelievably brilliant. Again and again biologists are fascinated with the brilliance of what's discovered. But the process itself is without purpose  without foresight  without design. When I was here four years ago  I told the story about an ant climbing a blade of grass. And why the ant was doing it was because its brain had been infected with a lancet fluke that was needed to get into the belly of a sheep or a cow in order to reproduce. So it was sort of a spooky story. And I think some people may have misunderstood. Lancet flukes aren't smart. I submit that the intelligence of a lancet fluke is down there  somewhere between petunia and carrot. They're not really bright. They don't have to be. The lesson we learn from this is  you don't have to have a mind to be a beneficiary. The design is there in nature  but it's not in anybody's head. It doesn't have to be. That's the way evolution works. Question  Was domestication good for sheep  It was great for their genetic fitness. And here I want to remind you of a wonderful point that Paul MacCready made at TED three years ago. Here's what he said   Ten thousand years ago  at the dawn of agriculture  human population  plus livestock and pets  was approximately a tenth of one percent of the terrestrial vertebrate landmass.  That was just        years ago. Yesterday  in biological terms. What is it today  Does anybody remember what he told us     percent. That is what we have done on this planet. Now  I talked to Paul afterwards    I wanted to check to find out how he'd calculated this  and get the sources and so forth    and he also gave me a paper that he had written on this. And there was a passage in it which he did not present here and I think it is so good  I'm going to read it to you   Over billions of years on a unique sphere  chance has painted a thin covering of life  complex  improbable  wonderful and fragile. Suddenly  we humans    a recently arrived species no longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature    have grown in population  technology and intelligence to a position of terrible power. We now wield the paintbrush.  We heard about the atmosphere as a thin layer of varnish. Life itself is just a thin coat of paint on this planet. And we're the ones that hold the paintbrush. And how can we do that  The key to our domination of the planet is culture. And the key to culture is religion. Suppose Martian scientists came to Earth. They would be puzzled by many things. Anybody know what this is  I'll tell you what it is. This is a million people gathering on the banks of the Ganges in       perhaps the largest single gathering of human beings ever  as seen from satellite photograph. Here's a big crowd. Here's another crowd in Mecca. Martians would be amazed by this. They'd want to know how it originated  what it was for and how it perpetuates itself. Actually  I'm going to pass over this. The ant isn't alone. There's all sorts of wonderful cases of species which    in that case    A parasite gets into a mouse and needs to get into the belly of a cat. And it turns the mouse into Mighty Mouse  makes it fearless  so it runs out in the open  where it'll be eaten by a cat. True story. In other words  we have these hijackers    you've seen this slide before  from four years ago    a parasite that infects the brain and induces even suicidal behavior  on behalf of a cause other than one's own genetic fitness. Does that ever happen to us  Yes  it does    quite wonderfully. The Arabic word  Islam  means  submission.  It means  surrender of self interest to the will of Allah.  But I'm not just talking about Islam. I'm talking also about Christianity. This is a parchment music page that I found in a Paris bookstall    years ago. And on it  it says  in Latin   Semen est verbum Dei. Sator autem Christus.  The word of God is the seed and the sower of the seed is Christ. Same idea. Well  not quite. But in fact  Christians  too ... glory in the fact that they have surrendered to God. I'll give you a few quotes.  The heart of worship is surrender. Surrendered people obey God's words  even if it doesn't make sense.  Those words are by Rick Warren. Those are from  The Purpose Driven Life.  And I want to turn now  briefly  to talk about that book  which I've read. You've all got a copy  and you've just heard the man. And what I want to do now is say a bit about this book from the design standpoint  because I think it's actually a brilliant book. First of all  the goal    and you heard just now what the goal is    it's to bring purpose to the lives of millions  and he has succeeded. Is it a good goal  In itself  I'm sure we all agree  it is a wonderful goal. He's absolutely right. There are lots of people out there who don't have purpose in their life  and bringing purpose to their life is a wonderful goal. I give him an A  on this. Is the goal achieved  Yes. Thirty million copies of this book. Al Gore  eat your heart out. Just exactly what Al is trying to do  Rick is doing. This is a fantastic achievement. And the means    how does he do it  It's a brilliant redesign of traditional religious themes    updating them  quietly dropping obsolete features  putting new interpretations on other features. This is the evolution of religion that's been going on for thousands of years  and he's just the latest brilliant practitioner of it. I don't have to tell you this  you just heard the man. Excellent insights into human psychology  wise advice on every page. Moreover  he invites us to look under the hood. I really appreciated that. For instance  he has an appendix where he explains his choice of translations of different Bible verses. The book is clear  vivid  accessible  beautifully formatted. Just enough repetition. That's really important. Every time you read it or say it  you make another copy in your brain. Every time you read it or say it  you make another copy in your brain. With me  everybody    you make another copy in your brain. Thank you. And now we come to my problem. Because I'm absolutely sincere in my appreciation of all that I said about this book. But I wish it were better. I have some problems with the book. And it would just be insincere of me not to address those problems. I wish he could do this with a revision  a Mark   version of his book.  The truth will set you free.  That's what it says in the Bible  and it's something that I want to live by  too. My problem is  some of the bits in it I don't think are true. Now some of this is a difference of opinion. And that's not my main complaint  that's worth mentioning. Here's a passage    it's very much what he said  anyway   If there was no God we would all be accidents  the result of astronomical random chance in the Universe. You could stop reading this book because life would have no purpose or meaning or significance. There would be no right or wrong and no hope beyond your brief years on Earth.  Now  I just do not believe that. By the way  I find    Homer Groening's film presented a beautiful alternative to that very claim. Yes  there is meaning and a reason for right or wrong. We don't need a belief in God to be good or to have meaning in us. But that  as I said  is just a difference of opinion. That's not what I'm really worried about. How about this   God designed this planet's environment just so we could live in it.  I'm afraid that a lot of people take that sentiment to mean that we don't have to do the sorts of things that Al Gore is trying so hard to get us to do. I am not happy with that sentiment at all. And then I find this   All the evidence available in the biological sciences supports the core proposition that the cosmos is a specially designed whole with life and mankind as its fundamental goal and purpose  a whole in which all facets of reality have their meaning and explanation in this central fact.  Well  that's Michael Denton. He's a creationist. And here  I think   Wait a minute.  I read this again. I read it three or four times and I think   Is he really endorsing Intelligent Design  Is he endorsing creationism here   And you can't tell. So I'm sort of thinking   Well  I don't know  I don't know if I want to get upset with this yet.  But then I read on  and I read this   First  Noah had never seen rain  because prior to the Flood  God irrigated the earth from the ground up.  I wish that sentence weren't in there  because I think it is false. And I think that thinking this way about the history of the planet  after we've just been hearing about the history of the planet over millions of years  discourages people from scientific understanding. Now  Rick Warren uses scientific terms and scientific factoids and information in a very interesting way. Here's one   God deliberately shaped and formed you to serve him in a way that makes your ministry unique. He carefully mixed the DNA cocktail that created you.  I think that's false. Now  maybe we want to treat it as metaphorical. Here's another one   For instance  your brain can store     trillion facts. Your mind can handle        decisions a second.  Well  it would be interesting to find the interpretation where I would accept that. There might be some way of treating that as true.  Anthropologists have noted that worship is a universal urge  hardwired by God into the very fiber of our being    an inbuilt need to connect with God.  Well  the sense of which I agree with him  except I think it has an evolutionary explanation. And what I find deeply troubling in this book is that he seems to be arguing that if you want to be moral  if you want to have meaning in your life  you have to be an Intelligent Designer  you have to deny the theory of evolution by natural selection. And I think  on the contrary  that it is very important to solving the world's problems that we take evolutionary biology seriously. Whose truth are we going to listen to  Well  this is from  The Purpose Driven Life    The Bible must become the authoritative standard for my life  the compass I rely on for direction  the counsel I listen to for making wise decisions  and the benchmark I use for evaluating everything.  Well maybe  OK  but what's going to follow from this  And here's one that does concern me. Remember I quoted him before with this line   Surrendered people obey God's word  even if it doesn't make sense.  And that's a problem.  Don't ever argue with the Devil. He's better at arguing than you are  having had thousands of years to practice.  Now  Rick Warren didn't invent this clever move. It's an old move. It's a very clever adaptation of religions. It's a wild card for disarming any reasonable criticism.  You don't like my interpretation  You've got a reasonable objection to it  Don't listen  don't listen  That's the Devil speaking.  This discourages the sort of reasoning citizenship it seems to me that we want to have. I've got one more problem  then I'm through. And I'd really like to get a response if Rick is able to do it.  In the Great Commission  Jesus said  'Go to all people of all nations and make them my disciples. Baptize them in the name of the Father  the Son and the Holy Spirit  and teach them to do everything I've told you.'  The Bible says Jesus is the only one who can save the world. We've seen many wonderful maps of the world in the last day or so. Here's one  not as beautiful as the others  it simply shows the religions of the world. Here's one that shows the sort of current breakdown of the different religions. Do we really want to commit ourselves to engulfing all the other religions  when their holy books are telling them   Don't listen to the other side  that's just Satan talking    It seems to me that that's a very problematic ship to get on for the future. I found this sign as I was driving to Maine recently  in front of a church   Good without God becomes zero.  Sort of cute. A very clever little meme. I don't believe it and I think this idea  popular as it is    not in this guise  but in general    is itself one of the main problems that we face. If you are like me  you know many wonderful  committed  engaged atheists  agnostics  who are being very good without God. And you also know many religious people who hide behind their sanctity instead of doing good works. So  I wish we could drop this meme. I wish this meme would go extinct. Thanks very much for your attention.
